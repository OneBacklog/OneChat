### Privacy

OneChat is a 100% client-side app that directly communicates with the GitHub Models Inference API; therefore, it has no backend server and everything is stored locally in your web browser.

### Dependencies

OneChat was built by slapping VueJS, MarkedJS and PicoCSS to a HTML file, so it doesn't require specific runtime or build process. You can run it yourself by opening the `index.html` file directly on any web browsers.
